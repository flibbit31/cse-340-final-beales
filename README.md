Project Management Site

This website is designed to provide project and other business management tools for the small business I am a part of as well as serving as my final project for CSE 340. 

Projects: The site will include projects that may be created or deleted by admins. Each project will include a name, description, creation date, creator.

Tasks: Each project may contain one or more tasks to be completed. Tasks work like a ticket system. An employee may submit a task for completion. Tasks include a name, description, priority, status (submitted, in progress, completed, archived), creator, and creation date. Only the original creator may mark the task completed or archive/unarchive a task.

Bonus feature: Subtasks: If I have time to implement them, subtasks would work exactly like tasks except they are attached to a task. All subtasks must be completed for a task to be considered complete.
